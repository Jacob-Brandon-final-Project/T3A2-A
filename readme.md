# R1: Description of your website, including:
- Purpose
- Functionality / features
- Target audience
- Tech stack

### Answer:
Jacob and I have chosen to build an E-commerce website for a family friend that performs live stream 'box breaks' of basketball cards. For those not up to date on this phenomena, a group of people (30 in this case) chip in money for a spot in the break ($24 AUD in our case). The break is then live streamed and hopefully you may win some expensive shiny new cards that would be more worth more than paying for the spot in the break itself. The client has been involved with all things collectable for over 20 years and has been involved with their streaming breaks for the past 3 years. This has provided the client with a sufficient income stream ever since.

-  Purpose of the website: is for the client to be able to expand their brand. They wish to attract new customers to the new e-commerce store, promote the box breaks via the website to attract more participants to the breaks, thereby allowing for more variety and sales through those streaming sites for views, which in return will boost revenue from sites like Facebook, Twitch and Instagram and You-tube. The website will provide additional revenue from providing the client 

- Functionality / Features of this site will be:
    - Product listings: The website will display the available products for purchase, including details such as price, product description and images of the product for sale. Customers would be able to browse through products and add items to their cart.
    - Shopping cart: The website would allow customers to add/remove items from their shopping cart and view total cost of their order. 
    - Payment processing: The website would allow integrate with Stripe payment processing to securely process customer payments.
    - Customer accounts: The website would allow customers to create an account and store their personal information, such as shipping and billing addresses. Maybe manage order history(?) or track status of current order(?).
    - Search functionality: The website would include a search bar that customers could use to search items. This may have a filter function that supports advanced search features such as search by card, search all, search by team, search by genre...basketball, dragon ball z and magic the gathering! So many choices!
    - Multilingual support(?): The website may just focus on sales and shipping throughout Australia and New Zealand at present so we don't have to focus on international shipping, local laws and customs etc. Otherwise a component that handles different languages could be awesome! (maybe German).
    - User-friendly navigation: Easy to read navbar and an awesome search button should make it easy for customers to use and find what they are looking for.
    - Wishlist: The website could include a feature that allows customers to save items that they may wish to keep for a future purchase.
    - create the back-end API for the website to CRUD items for sale, user authentication/authorisation, store user information, generate emails through 3rd party apps, create routes and servers etc.
    - Customer Service: perhaps a contact form or chatbot(if I am clever enough?) to assist customers with any questions, queries, theories or thoughts they may have.


- Target Audience: The target audience for this E-commerce website that live streams box breaks of basketball cards and that sells cards and collectables and other memorabilia would be those people who have an interest in basketball cards and other collectables:

    - Sport enthusiasts: People who are passionate about sports and enjoy collecting sports memorabilia, including basketball cards.
    - Card collectors: People who collect basketball cards, as well as people who like collecting Magic the Gathering, dragon ball z and perhaps Pokemon cards.
    - Investors: People who see basketball cards and other collectables as investments and are interested in purchasing rare or valuable cards through an E-commerce website store or through live stream box breaks.
    - Gift shoppers: People looking for that one-off card for a friend or family member that are interested in basketball cards or collectables.
    - Social media followers: People who follow the clients social media accounts and channels for the live banter and interactions (host reactions when they reveal an expensive card, for example).


- Tech stack: Here is a quick run-down on the technology we will be attempting to use to build the client's E-commerce website:
    - Bootstrap CSS: CSS Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that provides pre-built CSS and JavaScript components for creating responsive and mobile first websites. it helps create a consistent look and feel across the website and saves some time by providing pre-built components.
    - JavaScript:  Is a programming language used to create interactive and dynamic websites. It is most commonly used for client-side scripting, such as validating forms, creating animations and manipulating HTML and CSS.
    - HTML: Is a mark-up language used to create structure and content on web pages. It defines the elements and attributes of a web page and how they are displayed in a browser. 
    - MongoDB: Mongo DB is a NoSQL document database that stores data in JSON-like documents. It is scalable, flexible and provides high-performance for handling large amounts of data.
    - Express.js: Is a popular Node.js web application framework that provides a set of features for building web applications including routing, middleware and error handling.
    - React.js: Is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It provides a component-based architecture that makes it easy to reuse code and manage complex User Interfaces (UIs).
    - Node.js: Is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers (us) to run JavaScript on the server-side. It provides a set of built-in modules for handling Input/Output operations, networking and file system access.
